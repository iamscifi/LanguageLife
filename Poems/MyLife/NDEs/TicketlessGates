Storytime. 
A poem of sorts. 
About the time I remember not dying—
but being removed from time.

There's a word inside my head
what it is
not allowed to say

said no one in particular 
yet 
yield 
comand—
does everything inside
of
me—
sans feeling hints of some almost recalled, always unrecalled feeling that can't be described except by passing through one's 

























ultimate gate. 

17 years! 

after passing through mine

finally
Finally
FINALLY
FINALLY!

a definition 

swims into my inner existence|all the way through some series of tubes|into|&|through 
all 
of 
you  

Word
Unknown
Now
Defined
Dancing in a symphony of light.
